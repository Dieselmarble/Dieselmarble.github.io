This novel linear motor is one of the projects  during my placement at Ocado Technolgy. I designed and developed this linear motor independently, from mechanical CAD to embedded programming in C.

I use STM32F4 microcontroller and six step inverter to perform Back EMF sensorless control.

This project is still at an ongoing basis.
