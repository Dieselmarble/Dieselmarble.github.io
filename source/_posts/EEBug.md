This simple line following robot was my first year university project. It uses infrared emitter and sensor to detect dimmed track beneath it. An microcontroller calibrates the two MOSFETs' base driving voltages based on feedback analogue readings.

Although there was not much advanced technology apllied into this project. It has inspired my passion in enginnering and witnessed my step by step growth.
