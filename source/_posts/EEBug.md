This simple line following robot was my first year university project. It uses infrared emitter and sensor to detect dimmed track beneath it, analogue readings feed back into an ATtiny microcontroller which maintain the robot in line by driving two MOSFETS.

Although there was not much advanced technology apllied into this project. It has inspired my passion in enginnering and witnessed my step by step growth.
