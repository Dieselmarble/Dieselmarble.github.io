This smart door locker provieds an intuitive but secure way to encrypted your secrets from the outside world. 
A matrix of piezo sensors are mounted on the back of the door, feeding the vibration signals to an Arduino which runs a real time analysis algorithm. Once knocking pattern is matched with the saved password, a servo rotates to unlock the door. A user interface runs on LCD display provides a bunch of useful functions such as password reset and leaving a message.
