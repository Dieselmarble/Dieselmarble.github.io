### The outlook of my linear motor

![](/uploads/motor.jpg)

This novel linear motor is one of the projects  during my placement at Ocado Technolgy. I designed and developed this linear motor independently, from mechanical CAD to embedded programming in C.

I use STM32F4 microcontroller and six step inverter to perform Back EMF sensorless control.

### Some testing result
