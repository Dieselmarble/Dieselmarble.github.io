This three joint robotic hand(DMT_Hand) was designed to pick up heavy staff and installed on robot ["De Niro"](http://www.imperial.ac.uk/robot-intelligence/robots/robot_de_niro/) in Robot Intelligence Lab, Imperial College London.

I use ROS(robotic operating system) and python to develop a full custom robot control script and graphic user interface based on open source APIs provided by Dynamixel servo.

My controller is capable in torque, speed, position control and can pefrom any user defined motion profile. All functions and pressure sensor readings can be accessed through the GUI.

A human-robot interaction glove enables the robot hand to imitate human's motion simutaneously.
