### The outlook of my linear motor

This novel linear motor is one of the projects  during my placement at Ocado Technolgy. I designed and developed this linear motor independently, from mechanical CAD to embedded programming in C.

I use STM32 microcontroller and six step inverter to perform Back EMF sensorless control.

### Some testing result
